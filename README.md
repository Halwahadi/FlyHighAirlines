Airline Reservation System

This is an airline reservation system written in Java that allows users to book a flight from Atlanta, GA to anywhere in the United States. 
It keeps track of all passengers, flights, and tickets using mySQL database 

This is a project I am currently working on so all the information is slowly being posted and updated.

To Do: (X means completed)

X Create Database in mySQL
X Connect Database to Java Project
X Passenger()

  x Retrieve passenger
  x Update Passenger
  x Delete Passenger
- Book Flight()
- Get Ticket()
  -Discard Ticket
